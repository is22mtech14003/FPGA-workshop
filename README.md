## Counter Synthesis
synthesis is the process that converts RTL into a technologyspecific gate-level netlist, optimized for a set of pre-defined constraints.

The below snippet show sthe schematic generated by the Vivado synthesis tool.

## Constraints

Constraints in simple are the specifications of your design like timing specifications, ports declaration, input/output delays, etc

# Bitstream

A bitstream is a binary sequence that comprises a sequence of bits. These are used in FPGA applications for programming purposes and to establish communication channels. FPGA bitstream is a file containing the programming data associated with your FPGA chip.

# Counter Timing, Power and Area

Implementation of a design also gives details like the timing summary, device utilization, power analysis, etc. The below snippets show the brief timing sumary, implementation and power analysis of the up-counter desi

# Day 2 Exploring OpenFPGA, VPR and VTR

## Introduction To OpenFPGA

The OpenFPGA framework is the first open-source FPGA IP generator which supports highly-customizable homogeneous FPGA architectures. OpenFPGA provides a full set of EDA support for customized FPGAs, including Verilog-to-bitstream generation and self-testing verification. OpenFPGA targets to democratizing FPGA technology and EDA techniques, with agile prototyping approaches and constantly evolving EDA tools for chip designers and researchers.

Some key features of OpenFPGA are: - Use of Automation Techniques - Reduction of FPGA developement cycle to few days - Provides open source design tools


# VPR

VPR (Versatile Place and Route) is an open source academic CAD tool designed for the exploration of new FPGA architectures and CAD algorithms, at the packing, placement and routing phases of the CAD flow. As input, VPR takes a description of an FPGA architecture along with a technology-mapped user circuit. It then performs packing, placement, and routing to map the circuit onto the FPGA. The output of VPR includes the FPGA configuration needed to implement the circuit and statistics about the final mapped design (eg. critical path delay, area, etc).

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120499567/208111957-8559ee0c-55da-4cc5-9ccc-8035fc3cbf63.png)

To invoke VPR from terminal:

``` js
$VTR_ROOT/vpr/vpr \
 $VTR_ROOT/vtr_flow/arch/timing/EArch.xml \
 <blif-file-path \
 --route_chan_width 100 \
 --disp on
 ```
 
### The basic VPR flow involves below mentioned steps:

- Packing - combinines primitives into complex blocks
- Placment - places complex blocks within the FPGA grid
- Routing - determines interconnections between blocks
- Analysis - analyzes the implementation

# VTR

The Verilog to Routing (VTR) project provides open-source CAD tools for FPGA architecture and CAD research. The VTR design flow takes as input a Verilog description of a digital circuit, and a description of the target FPGA architecture

### To invoke VTR from command-line:

``` js
$VTR_ROOT/vtr_flow/scripts/run_vtr_flow.py \ 
  $VTR_ROOT/doc/src/<verilog-file-path>
  $VTR_ROOT/vtr_flow/arch/timing/EArch.xml \
  -temp_dir . \
  --route_chan_width 100 
  ```
  
  # VTR Flow
  
  The basic VTR flow perfoms:
  
  - Elaboration & Synthesis (ODIN II)
  - Logic Optimization & Technology Mapping (ABC)
  - Packing, Placement, Routing & Timing Analysis (VPR)
  
  The snippets mentioned below show some of the stages from the VTR flow
