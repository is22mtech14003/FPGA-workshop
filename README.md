## Introduction to FPGA

FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) are intergated circuits which have a complex arrangement of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) and programmable interconnects.

## FPGA vs ASIC Comparison

|FPGA|ASIC|
|:---:|:---:|
|Field Programmable Gate Array|Application Specific Integrated Circuit|
|:---:|:---:|
|RTL to Bitstream|Permanent Circuit|
|:---:|:---:|
|Less Energy Efficient. Required more power for same task as compared to ASIC|More energy efficient|
|:---:|:---:|
|Useful for prototyping or validating a design|Used for final product design after validation|
# FPGA Architecture
The FPGA Architecture primarily consists of : - Configurable Logic Blocks - Programmable Interconnects - I/O Cells - Memory / Block RAM
